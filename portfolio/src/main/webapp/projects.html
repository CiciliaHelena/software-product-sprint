                Akul is an abbreviation of “anak kuliah” which also means university student.
                This is an educational project on a youtube channel that discusses the tips and
                tricks on how to get into a famous university around the world. Not only that,
                it also covers the information about scholarship, school fees, and anything you need
                to know to survive financially. The targeted audiences are Indonesian youths who want
                to continue their studies to the top universities, yet do not have enough information
                to guide them through the process.

                ICN is an annual musical theatre production that brings a new perspective on Indonesian
                folklore and history to the Singapore community. I participated as a sound effect designer,
                and collaborated with the scriptwriter to design the first real-time sound effects in ICN history!
                That actually took me weeks to practice to press and start the sound based on the character's
                movement. I had 4 important fighting scenes to focus on that I worried the most, as I need to remember
                long choreographies for each. I was so happy and grateful for the show, all our hard work paid off.

                We led several teaching sessions for five days covering handcrafting, norms, virtues, and leadership
                through games and activities for 35 marginal children of age 5-18. Interactions with children are
                very challenging as we need to be a good example for them. We must keep in mind all the time that
                our wrongdoing towards them is very dangerous, as it can ruin their confidence and even their future.
